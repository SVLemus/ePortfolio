# ePortfolio



## Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths, refine my professional goals, and prepare for a career in the tech industry. Through hands on projects and coursework, I’ve developed a solid foundation in software engineering, data structures, databases, and security all critical areas in today’s job market.

Team collaboration and stakeholder communication were key parts of my learning experience in my courses throughout my program. I’ve also grown confident in presenting technical concepts to both technical and non technical audiences.

My technical strengths include optimizing algorithms, writing scalable code, and building secure database systems. For example, I improved performance in a Java based contact manager by switching from an ArrayList to a HashMap. In a separate Python project, I enhanced a MongoDBbased animal shelter system with indexing, aggregation pipelines, and role based access control.

The artifacts in this portfolio reflect my ability to analyze, enhance, and implement real world applications using industry best practices. They demonstrate how my skills in software development, data handling, and system security come together to solve practical problems efficiently and effectively.

With this foundation, I’m confident in my ability to contribute to development teams and grow as a professional in the computer science field.

# Informal Code Review

## Summary

My code review video includes two software artifacts: ContactService.java and AnimalShelter.py. I review each artifact individually to identify design issues, performance inefficiencies, and opportunities for enhancement. During the walkthrough of each artifact, I explain my plans for improvement and how these align with industry best practices. For the engineering and design, as well as algorithms and data structures topics, I analyze and demonstrate enhancements in ContactService.java using Java. For the database topic, I showcase AnimalShelter.py in Python. Throughout the video, I apply clear, professional, and technically sound oral, visual, and written communication strategies to present a coherent and accessible code review experience suitable for a professional or academic audience. My review centers around three essential aspects:

## Existing Functionality:
I begin by walking through the current structure and functionality of each code artifact. For ContactService.java, I explain how contacts are managed using an ArrayList, highlighting its limitations. For AnimalShelter.py, I cover how it currently supports basic CRUD operations using MongoDB.

## Code Analysis:
I identify areas for improvement, such as repeated logic, inefficient data structures, minimal error handling, and limited scalability. In ContactService.java, I point out opportunities to refactor methods for better modularity and to improve lookup efficiency by replacing the ArrayList with a HashMap. In AnimalShelter.py, I emphasize the need for comprehensive error handling, full CRUD coverage, and optimizations like indexing and aggregation pipelines.

## Enhancements:
I describe and demonstrate planned enhancements. In ContactService.java, I break down larger methods, apply the Single Responsibility Principle, and switch to a HashMap for better performance. In AnimalShelter.py, I add update and delete operations, improve error handling by catching specific exceptions, implement indexing for commonly queried fields, integrate aggregation pipelines for reporting, and introduce user authentication and role-based access control to secure data access.

By implementing these enhancements, both artifacts are transformed into more efficient, scalable, and secure systems, prepared for real world application in production environments.
