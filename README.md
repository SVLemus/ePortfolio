### Self-Assessment



# Informal Code Review

## Summary

My code review video includes two software artifacts: ContactService.java and AnimalShelter.py. I review each artifact individually to identify design issues, performance inefficiencies, and opportunities for enhancement. During the walkthrough of each artifact, I explain my plans for improvement and how these align with industry best practices. For the engineering and design, as well as algorithms and data structures topics, I analyze and demonstrate enhancements in ContactService.java using Java. For the database topic, I showcase AnimalShelter.py in Python, using PyCharm to explore improvements in database interaction and data security. Throughout the video, I apply clear, professional, and technically sound oral, visual, and written communication strategies to present a coherent and accessible code review experience suitable for a professional or academic audience. My review centers around three essential aspects:

## Existing Functionality:
I begin by walking through the current structure and functionality of each code artifact. For ContactService.java, I explain how contacts are managed using an ArrayList, highlighting its limitations. For AnimalShelter.py, I cover how it currently supports basic CRUD operations using MongoDB.

## Code Analysis:
I identify areas for improvement, such as repeated logic, inefficient data structures, minimal error handling, and limited scalability. In ContactService.java, I point out opportunities to refactor methods for better modularity and to improve lookup efficiency by replacing the ArrayList with a HashMap. In AnimalShelter.py, I emphasize the need for comprehensive error handling, full CRUD coverage, and optimizations like indexing and aggregation pipelines.

## Enhancements:
I describe and demonstrate planned enhancements. In ContactService.java, I break down larger methods, apply the Single Responsibility Principle, and switch to a HashMap for better performance. In AnimalShelter.py, I add update and delete operations, improve error handling by catching specific exceptions, implement indexing for commonly queried fields, integrate aggregation pipelines for reporting, and introduce user authentication and role-based access control to secure data access.

By implementing these enhancements, both artifacts are transformed into more efficient, scalable, and secure systems, prepared for real-world application in production environments.
