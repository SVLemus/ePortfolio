# ePortfolio



## Self-Assessment

Throughout my Computer Science program, I’ve developed a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, databases, and security. Creating this ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to reflect on my growth and present technical artifacts that demonstrate my capabilities and readiness for a career in the field.

Developing and enhancing real-world applications helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and apply industry best practices. I’ve learned to communicate effectively by clearly explaining technical decisions and justifying enhancements through documentation and presentations.

For example, I optimized a Java contact management system by replacing an inefficient ArrayList with a HashMap, significantly improving lookup performance. In a Python-based MongoDB project, I implemented indexing, aggregation pipelines, and role-based access control to create a more secure and scalable system.

These artifacts showcase my ability to design, analyze, and improve software systems. Together, they highlight my technical strengths and my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and secure code. My coursework and this portfolio have prepared me to confidently enter the computer science field and continue growing as a professional.

# Informal Code Review

## Summary

My code review video includes two software artifacts: ContactService.java and AnimalShelter.py. I review each artifact individually to identify design issues, performance inefficiencies, and opportunities for enhancement. During the walkthrough of each artifact, I explain my plans for improvement and how these align with industry best practices. For the engineering and design, as well as algorithms and data structures topics, I analyze and demonstrate enhancements in ContactService.java using Java. For the database topic, I showcase AnimalShelter.py in Python. Throughout the video, I apply clear, professional, and technically sound oral, visual, and written communication strategies to present a coherent and accessible code review experience suitable for a professional or academic audience. My review centers around three essential aspects:

## Existing Functionality:
I begin by walking through the current structure and functionality of each code artifact. For ContactService.java, I explain how contacts are managed using an ArrayList, highlighting its limitations. For AnimalShelter.py, I cover how it currently supports basic CRUD operations using MongoDB.

## Code Analysis:
I identify areas for improvement, such as repeated logic, inefficient data structures, minimal error handling, and limited scalability. In ContactService.java, I point out opportunities to refactor methods for better modularity and to improve lookup efficiency by replacing the ArrayList with a HashMap. In AnimalShelter.py, I emphasize the need for comprehensive error handling, full CRUD coverage, and optimizations like indexing and aggregation pipelines.

## Enhancements:
I describe and demonstrate planned enhancements. In ContactService.java, I break down larger methods, apply the Single Responsibility Principle, and switch to a HashMap for better performance. In AnimalShelter.py, I add update and delete operations, improve error handling by catching specific exceptions, implement indexing for commonly queried fields, integrate aggregation pipelines for reporting, and introduce user authentication and role-based access control to secure data access.

By implementing these enhancements, both artifacts are transformed into more efficient, scalable, and secure systems, prepared for real-world application in production environments.
